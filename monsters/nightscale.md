## History with the Party

Nightscale laired in the submerged caverns beneath **Stone Tooth**, the dwarven mountain fortress also known as the **Forge of Fury**. She occupied the underground lake at the deepest level of the dungeon — a flooded natural cavern connected to subterranean river systems that run beneath the Star Mountains and the Lost Peaks.

The party encountered Nightscale during their expedition through the Forge of Fury (approximately **level 4–5**). The fight was brutal and nearly ended the party. Nightscale used the water and the darkness to her advantage, striking from below and retreating into the flooded tunnels when pressed.

The party won — barely — but **Nightscale escaped**. She fled through the underwater passages, wounded and humiliated, and was not seen again during the remainder of the Stone Tooth campaign.

**Key detail:** The underground river system that Nightscale fled through connects Stone Tooth to **Hammersong Hall** — the ancestral dwarven kingdom that Ollum subsequently reclaimed. The dragon's escape route runs directly past Ollum's doorstep.

## The Five-Year Gap

During the timeskip, Nightscale has not been idle. Black dragons are patient, cunning, and vindictive. Being driven from her lair by a band of adventurers — including a *bard* — would be a wound to her pride far deeper than any blade.

### What She's Been Doing

**Years 1–2: Recovery and Relocation**
- Fled south through the underground waterways, eventually surfacing in the marshlands near the **Mere of Dead Men** or the swampy lowlands south of the High Forest
- Recovered from her wounds in isolation. Hunted carefully. Rebuilt strength
- A young black dragon licking its wounds is still a deadly predator — just a quiet one

**Years 3–4: Growth and Territory**
- Black dragons grow rapidly when well-fed and unchallenged. Five years is enough to push Nightscale from young toward the **adult** age category
- Began establishing territory in the High Forest corridor between the Star Mountains and the Mere of Dead Men
- Started poisoning the land — acidic runoff killing vegetation, corrupting water sources, driving out competing predators. Classic black dragon territorial behavior
- Likely attracted followers: lizardfolk, kobolds, or other swamp-dwelling creatures drawn to a dragon's power
- May have begun accumulating a hoard from raided caravans and settlements

**Year 5: Escalation**
- Destroyed a Mirabar trade caravan (Thornhelm company, 12 wagons, 20+ guards) in the eastern High Forest. The sole survivor described acid attacks from above and said the dragon *laughed*
- Melted a 200-yard stretch of ancient oak forest near the Dessarin Hills
- Killed an entire flock of sheep on the northern edge of the High Forest — acid, overnight
- Spotted flying at night three times by a ranger named **Earsa**, each sighting larger than the last
- The underground river connecting Stone Tooth to Hammersong Hall has turned **acidic** — dead fish, corroded stone, caustic water. This is either territorial marking, a deliberate provocation, or reconnaissance

## Personality and Tactics

**Cunning over brute force.** Black dragons are among the most intelligent and sadistic of the chromatics. Nightscale doesn't just want to destroy Hammersong Hall — she wants Ollum to *know she's coming*. The acidic river, the attacks circling ever closer to the Lost Peaks — these are deliberate. She's tightening a noose.

**Patient grudge.** Five years of growth and planning. She remembers every member of the party that humiliated her. She especially remembers the dwarf who hit her with a hammer while *singing*.

**Water and darkness.** Nightscale's preferred environment is flooded caverns, swamps, and darkness. She will always try to fight on her terms — dragging enemies into water, attacking at night, using her acid breath in enclosed spaces where it pools and lingers.

**Laughs at suffering.** The caravan survivor specifically reported that the dragon laughed during the attack. Black dragons take genuine pleasure in fear and pain. Nightscale is not a mindless predator — she is cruel by choice.

## Stat Block Notes

At the time of the Forge of Fury encounter, Nightscale was a **Young Black Dragon** (MM p. 88). After five years of growth, she should be transitioning toward **Adult Black Dragon** stats. Options for the DM:

- **Option A — Full Adult** (CR 14): Use the Adult Black Dragon stat block as-is. Simple, dramatic power jump. Appropriate if Nightscale returns as a major threat at higher levels.
- **Option B — Enhanced Young** (CR 9–10): Keep the Young Black Dragon base but add hit points, increase AC by 1, boost breath weapon damage by 1–2 dice, and add Legendary Resistance (1/day). Represents meaningful growth without the full adult jump. Better for a mid-campaign encounter.
- **Option C — Custom Hybrid**: Start from the Young stat block and selectively add Adult features — Frightful Presence, increased breath weapon range, Legendary Actions (1–2 instead of 3). Lets you tailor the difficulty precisely.

### Recommended Additions (Any Option)

- **Lair actions** if fought in her new territory (acid pools, grasping water, darkness)
- **Regional effects**: corrupted water within 6 miles, fog and foul air, vegetation dying
- **Minions**: lizardfolk warband, giant crocodiles, or black dragon wyrmlings if she's been breeding
- **Tactical intelligence**: She knows the underground river system. She knows Hammersong Hall's layout from when she lived beneath Stone Tooth. She will exploit this

## Plot Hooks

### Near-Term (Vecna Campaign)
- The Nightscale threat is one more reason Ollum can't stay at Hammersong Hall — and one more reason it kills him to leave
- Bronn's reports about Nightscale's escalation can continue arriving between chapters, keeping the tension alive even while the party is on other planes
- The Zhentarim or Vecna's cult could attempt to **ally with or manipulate Nightscale** — a dragon terrorizing the High Forest serves their goal of keeping dwarven holds isolated and distracted

### Long-Term (Post-Vecna)
- Nightscale as a **major antagonist** for a post-Vecna arc focused on Hammersong Hall and Ollum's kingdom
- A full dragon hunt through the High Forest and into whatever lair she's established
- The underground river as a literal path between Ollum's kingdom and his oldest enemy
- Potential for Nightscale to have grown even further if the campaign runs long — toward Ancient if needed

### Personal Stakes
- Nightscale is Ollum's problem in a way no other threat is. She lived beneath *his* ancestral home. She fled through *his* tunnels. She's poisoning *his* river and terrorizing *his* trade routes. This is the dragon that got away, and every day she grows stronger is a day Ollum's kingdom grows less safe.
- Hammer's Song may have opinions about Nightscale — a sentient dwarven weapon would have strong feelings about a dragon squatting in dwarven halls.
