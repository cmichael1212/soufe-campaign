# Correspondence: Planning the Neverwinter Reunion

*A short exchange of letters between Thulduran Gleamshadow and King Ollum Hammersong, late Year Five / early Year Six of the timeskip. These letters establish why both characters converge on Neverwinter at the start of Vecna: Eve of Ruin.*

## Letter 1 — Ollum to Thulduran

*Year Five, month of Marpenoth. Delivered by trade courier from Hammersong Hall to Selenar's estate in Silverymoon, then forwarded to the Waterdeep workshop. Several ale stains. One boot print.*

THULLY!

I know you're going to read this and immediately start calculating how long it's been since we last saw each other in person, so I'll save you the trouble — TOO LONG. I was in Waterdeep three tendays ago on Hall business and swung by your workshop but Krath said you'd left for Silverymoon the day before. THE DAY BEFORE. I stood in your doorway, Thully. I could still smell whatever you'd been burning. Krath said it was "probably intentional." I am choosing to believe her.

Before that, I was through Silverymoon in Eleasias hoping to catch you there, but Aldenmere — that weaselly little man, I don't like him and I don't care who knows it — said you'd gone south to Waterdeep for "materials procurement." We keep MISSING each other and it's driving me mad.

Anyway. Here's the thing.

I need to go to Neverwinter. PROPERLY go, not just pass through singing at taverns, though I'll be doing that too obviously. Hammersong Hall needs trade routes, Thully. Real ones. We can't keep relying on Mirabar caravans that charge us double because they know we've got no alternatives. I've been writing to contacts in Gauntlgrym and Citadel Adbar about establishing a trade consortium — dwarven holds working together instead of squabbling over the same ore contracts. Bronn says I'm "thinking too big" which means I'm thinking EXACTLY the right size.

But the key to any of it is Neverwinter. Lord Neverember controls the trade routes along the coast and I need his backing, or at least his not-active-opposition, before any of the big holds will take Hammersong seriously. I've met the man — you remember, at that miserable gala where you hid behind a bookcase for two hours — and he seemed well enough disposed toward me. But that was when I was just a colorful adventurer. Now I'm a king asking for trade concessions, which is a different kind of conversation entirely.

I'm planning to be in Neverwinter by mid-Uktar. A tenday, maybe two. Enough time to make my case to Neverember's trade council and shake every hand worth shaking.

Which brings me to you. Where in the nine hells ARE you going to be in Uktar? Don't tell me Silverymoon. Come to Neverwinter. We haven't had a proper drink since the Kythorn workshop trip and I've got TWO new ballads and a limerick about Thandril that I think you'll find very satisfying.

Also — and this is separate but important — we need to talk about Trollskull Manor. I got a letter from Lif last month. Yes, THE GHOST. He's apparently learned to write by pushing a quill with whatever ghosts push things with. The letter was mostly complaints. The current manager — that half-elf, what's her name, Thessaly? — apparently waters the ale and Lif is "disgusted beyond the capacity of death to express." His words. Roughly. The handwriting was terrible.

Point is, the Manor's been running itself for years and maybe that's fine, but I'd rather not lose the best tavern in the North Ward to bad management while we're both too busy to notice. We should sort it out while we're both in the same city. Or the same REGION, at least.

Write back FAST. I mean it. None of your usual three-tenday silences where you're "deep in research" which we both know means you forgot.

— O.

P.S. Hammer's Song says hello. Well, it sort of HUMMED when I mentioned your name. I'm counting that as hello. It doesn't hum for most people. You should feel honored.

## Letter 2 — Thulduran to Ollum

*Year Five, month of Marpenoth. Delivered by private courier from Waterdeep to Hammersong Hall. Precisely folded. No stains of any kind. A small ink drawing of Skitter in the margin, apparently added as an afterthought.*

---

Ollum,

Your letter arrived. I will not comment on its physical condition except to note that the courier apologized on your behalf for the boot print, which suggests this is not the first time he has delivered correspondence in such a state.

You are correct that we have been missing each other. I was aware of your Waterdeep visit — Krath mentioned it when I returned, along with the observation that you "ate everything in the cold box and left singing." I have since restocked the cold box. The singing, I assume, was inflicted upon the street at large. My condolences to the Trades Ward.

I am going to tell you something and I need you to read it carefully, which I know is difficult for you when there are no capital letters to guide your attention.

I need to go to Neverwinter as well.

The telescope — and before you glaze over, this is RELEVANT to you — has been showing me increased disturbances along the Sword Coast for the past several months. The planar shimmers I have been tracking are not merely present near Neverwinter. They are *concentrating* there. The readings are unlike anything I have recorded in five years of observation. Something is thinning the boundaries between planes, and whatever it is, Neverwinter appears to be at or near its epicenter.

I have heard rumors — through academic correspondence, not tavern gossip, though I acknowledge the overlap is larger than I would prefer — that strange phenomena have been reported in and around the city. Unexplained cold spots. Objects displaced. Sounds from empty rooms. The university here dismisses it as "localized thaumic residue," which is a polished way of saying they have no idea. I believe these are manifestations of what I have been observing through the telescope: the boundaries are weakening, and it is getting worse.

I need to observe from Neverwinter directly. I need to calibrate the telescope against local readings. And frankly, I need to speak to someone in the city who might have noticed these phenomena firsthand — someone with connections to Neverember's court who might know if anything official has been documented.

You, inconveniently, are exactly that person.

So yes. Neverwinter. Mid-Uktar. I will be there.

Regarding Trollskull Manor: I am aware of the management situation. I received a letter from Thessaly two months ago requesting additional funds for "renovations" that, upon inquiry, appear to consist primarily of redecorating the upstairs lounge. I declined. If Lif has resorted to written complaints, the situation may be worse than I assumed. Your suggestion that we address it is sound, though I would prefer we do so from Neverwinter rather than making a separate trip to Waterdeep. Perhaps we can send instructions, or better yet, find a more competent manager. I have no particular attachment to Thessaly — she was a compromise hire made in haste three years ago when neither of us had time to interview properly.

One more thing. I hesitate to mention this because I do not wish to alarm you, but I believe in the interest of mutual awareness: I have had the distinct impression, twice in the last month, that I was being followed in Waterdeep. Nothing I can substantiate. No faces I recognized. But after our difficulties with the Zhentarim, I have learned not to dismiss such feelings entirely. Be watchful on the road, Ollum. You are not exactly inconspicuous, and a dwarven king traveling with legendary weapons makes for an attractive target.

I will bring Skitter. His left foreleg is, as ever, nonfunctional on a forty-second cycle. He has recently begun collecting buttons in addition to copper coins. I cannot explain this and have stopped trying.

See you in Neverwinter. Try not to start a diplomatic incident before I arrive.

— T.

P.S. I do not "forget" to write. I prioritize. There is a difference, though I would not expect a man who resolves scheduling conflicts by shouting to appreciate the distinction.

## Letter 3 — Ollum to Thulduran

*Year Five, month of Uktar. Delivered by fast rider to Waterdeep. Hastily written — the ink is smudged in several places, as though the letter was folded before it dried.*

---

Thully,

Right. Several things.

FIRST — the planar business. I'll be honest, half of what you wrote went over my head like a crossbow bolt in a windstorm. But the part about things concentrating around Neverwinter — that I understood. And here's the thing. Bronn's been reporting strange activity near the Hall too. Not just the orc scouts — I told you about those — but miners hearing CHANTING in the deep tunnels. In a language nobody recognizes. And last tenday, one of the halfling cooks — Pimble, you'd remember her, she makes that mushroom stew you pretended not to enjoy — Pimble swore she saw a doorway in the lower passage that wasn't there the day before. Just a door-shaped shimmer in the rock, she said. Gone when she looked again.

I didn't think much of it at the time because Pimble also claims she once saw a dragon in her soup, but if what you're seeing through the telescope is real — and I've never known your instruments to be wrong, even when I wished they were — then maybe it's connected.

Something's happening, Thully. I can feel it in my bones, and Hammer's Song can feel it too. The weapon's been restless. Humming at odd hours. Warmth and cold at random, not connected to anything I'm doing. Last night it woke me up — not with sound, with a FEELING. Like someone grabbing your shoulder in the dark. I lay there for an hour waiting for it to happen again.

SECOND — Trollskull. I agree about Thessaly. She was fine when all we needed was someone to keep the taps running and not steal the silverware, but Lif's complaints have been getting more specific and more frequent and I trust that ghost's judgment on tavern management more than most living people's. Here's what I'm thinking: Volo owes us a favor. Several, actually. He's in Neverwinter half the time anyway, doing whatever it is Volo does. What if we asked him to look in on the place? Not MANAGE it — gods forbid — but he knows everyone in the hospitality trade and might know someone reliable we could hire. I'll bring it up with him when I get to town. He'll be at the Driftwood Tavern. He's ALWAYS at the Driftwood Tavern.

THIRD — the Zhentarim. I hear you. I'm not worried for myself — let them come, I'll give them a song they won't forget — but I've been careful on the roads. Bronn insisted I take two of our guard as far as Triboar, and I kept them on until Longsaddle before sending them back. Can't spare them longer than that, we're stretched thin as it is. But I'll have my eyes open. You do the same. Those black-hearted bastards have long memories and we made fools of them in Waterdeep.

I'll be at the Driftwood Tavern in Neverwinter by the 10th of Uktar. If you beat me there, get us a table near the fire and order something that isn't that horrible elven wine you pretend to enjoy. If I beat you there, I'll have already made friends with every person in the room and you'll hear me before you see me. As usual.

It'll be good to see you, Thully. Really good. Whatever's coming — and I think we both feel something IS coming — I'd rather face it next to the smartest, most aggravating gnome I've ever known than face it alone.

Don't tell anyone I said that either. I've got TWO reputations to protect now.

— O.

P.S. Bring Skitter. The little monster makes me laugh and I could use a laugh. Tell him I'll bring copper coins.

## Letter 4 — Thulduran to Ollum

*Year Five, late Marpenoth. A brief note, delivered to Hammersong Hall by the same courier who brought Ollum's previous letter north. Attached: a small brass gear, wrapped in cloth.*

---

Ollum,

Pimble's door. The chanting. Hammer's Song waking you in the night.

You are right that something is coming. The data no longer suggests it — it insists.

I will be at the Driftwood Tavern on the 10th. I will order whatever I please and you will endure it, as you endure all things, loudly and with unnecessary commentary.

The gear is for Skitter. He stripped it three days ago and I have not had time to reattach it. If he begins walking in circles, that is why. Do not let him near your coin purse.

I am... also glad we will be in the same city again. The work ahead may require both a telescope and a hammer, and I have spent enough years staring at doors I cannot open alone.

See you soon.

— T.

The elven wine is exceptional and your palate is a tragedy.
