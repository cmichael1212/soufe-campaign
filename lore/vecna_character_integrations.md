## The Telescope: Thulduran's Planar Instrument

The published adventure moves the party between planes via portals in Sigil and directions from the Wizards Three. Thulduran's telescope replaces the feeling of being passively shuttled around — instead, *he* is the reason they can navigate the multiverse. The telescope grows in capability as the adventure progresses.

### Why It Works

Thulduran spent five years studying "thinning points" — shimmers between planes he could detect but not resolve. Selenar studied the same phenomena before she disappeared. Vecna's Ritual of Remaking is tearing the boundaries between planes apart, which means the very thing Thulduran has been observing is now *accelerating*. His academic curiosity becomes existential urgency.

### Telescope Progression

**Phase 1 — Detection (Ch 1–2)**
The telescope detects planar disturbances but can't identify what lies beyond them. In Chapter 1, Jerot Galgin's notes mention "Crevices of Dusk" — planar gateways appearing in Neverwinter. These are exactly the thinning points Thulduran has been tracking. When the party is shunted through one during the disrupted ritual, Thulduran recognizes what happened — this wasn't random. The boundaries are weakening, and his years of research tell him it's getting worse.

In Sigil, the telescope can detect that the planes are under stress, confirming the Wizards Three's warnings with hard observational data. This earns Thulduran credibility with Alustriel's sanctum and gives him access to their resources.

**Phase 2 — Calibration (Ch 3–5)**
Each collected rod piece augments the Rod's divining power (it already grants Commune to locate the next piece). The telescope and the rod pieces create a feedback loop — the rod provides direction, the telescope resolves the destination. Thulduran can now identify *which* plane a thinning point connects to before the party steps through.

Mechanical benefit: Before each planar journey, Thulduran can spend time observing through the telescope to give the party advance intel — the general "feel" of the destination plane. In the Mournland (Ch 4), he might detect the muddled magical interference and warn the party that their spells will behave strangely. In Barovia (Ch 5), the telescope shows oppressive darkness and the faint signature of undeath saturating an entire demiplane.

**Phase 3 — Resolution (Ch 6–8)**
The telescope can now distinguish between planes with precision. Thulduran can read planar signatures the way a navigator reads stars. This becomes tactically critical — the party isn't just following the rod blindly, they're making informed decisions about preparation and approach.

Key moment: Somewhere in this phase, the telescope detects something wrong about the sanctum in Sigil. The planar signature of "Mordenkainen" doesn't match what a mortal archmage should read as. Thulduran might not understand what he's seeing immediately, but it plants seeds of doubt before Kas's betrayal in Chapter 9. (This maps to the published adventure's "Evidence of Deception" section — the clues that Mordenkainen is an impostor.)

**Phase 4 — Pursuit (Ch 9–10)**
When Kas reveals himself and flees to Pandemonium, the telescope becomes the party's tracking instrument. The published adventure has the party follow Kas's trail through Pandemonium. With the telescope, Thulduran can detect Kas's planar wake — the disturbance left by a powerful vampire warlord tearing through reality with the assembled Rod. This makes the chase feel active rather than scripted.

**Phase 5 — Sight Beyond Sight (Ch 11)**
In the Cave of Shattered Reflection, Vecna has created "unrealities" — twisted demiplanes showing his vision of a remade multiverse. The telescope was built to separate planar frequencies, to see what lies beyond shimmers. In the final chapter, it does exactly that — Thulduran can peer through Vecna's illusions and identify which unrealities are closest to collapsing, guiding the party's strategy in the final confrontation.

## Selenar's Disappearance: The Thread That Pulls Thulduran In

Selenar was studying planar convergences years before Thulduran. Her notebooks end mid-sentence. She followed the same path and vanished.

### Integration Points

**Ch 1 (Neverwinter):** Among Jerot Galgin's notes and research in the cult's lair, Thulduran finds a passing reference to a "gnomish scholar" who was observed near a Crevice of Dusk years ago — before the cult even understood what the Crevices were. It's not much. A footnote. But Thulduran would recognize the description.

**Ch 2 (Sigil):** Alustriel's library in the sanctum contains correspondence from various scholars who've studied planar phenomena. Among them: a letter from Selenar to Alustriel, dated shortly before her disappearance, requesting a meeting to discuss "urgent findings regarding accelerating convergence events." The meeting never happened.

**Ch 4 (Mournland) or Ch 7 (Greyhawk):** Evidence that Selenar actually succeeded in stepping through a thinning point — a journal page, an inscription, an item she carried. She made it through to another plane. She's not dead. But she went deeper.

**Ch 11 (Cave of Shattered Reflection):** The cave manifests unrealities drawn from powerful secrets and fears. One of Vecna's unrealities could be built from *Thulduran's* fear — a vision of Selenar, alive but trapped, calling to him from behind a barrier he can't breach. Dismantling this unreality requires Thulduran to confront the possibility that saving her means finishing what she started — and that her research was right all along.

**Post-adventure hook:** Selenar's fate isn't resolved by defeating Vecna. The planar boundaries stabilize, but the door she walked through is still out there. This gives Thulduran a reason to keep going after the campaign ends.

## Ollum's Political Drama: The King Whose Kingdom Is at Stake

Ollum's arc is about what it means to be a king — not by inheritance or conquest, but by stubborn refusal to give up. The published adventure threatens to unmake the multiverse. For Ollum, the multiverse is personal: it's Hammersong Hall's forty-three people, Dagnabbet's letters, the Battlehammer clan's dismissal, and the question of whether a bard can hold stone.

### Pre-Adventure Hook: Vecna's Reach Into Dwarven Politics

The orc scouts Bronn reported (Year Three) weren't random. Vecna's cult has been sowing instability across the Sword Coast to create chaos and extract secrets. Among their methods: agitating orc clans near vulnerable settlements to force dwarven holds to turn inward, undermining alliances, and stealing political secrets that weaken trust between clans.

Hammersong Hall's fragile position — 43 people, an unproven claim, a king who's often away — makes it a perfect target. Not to destroy it, but to keep it weak and distracted. The cult doesn't need Hammersong Hall; they need Ollum to be too busy fighting for legitimacy to notice what's happening in Neverwinter.

This recontextualizes Ollum's political struggles. The Battlehammer clan's dismissive letter? Maybe it was genuine dwarven skepticism. Or maybe the cult amplified it — leaked a secret, spread a rumor, ensured that Hammersong Hall stayed isolated.

### Chapter-by-Chapter Integration

**Ch 1 (Neverwinter):** Among the four kidnapped nobles, Ebbon Keyward is a scholar specializing in the Outer Planes. What if Ollum knows him — or knows *of* him — because Keyward had expressed interest in Hammersong Hall's historical records? Dwarven holds keep meticulous records stretching back centuries. Vecna's cult didn't kidnap Keyward randomly; his knowledge of planar connections *and* his access to dwarven historical secrets made him doubly valuable.

Ollum's "Purpose in Neverwinter" is natural: he's there on Hammersong Hall business — attempting to establish trade relationships or diplomatic recognition. Lord Neverember summons him because Ollum's reputation as an adventurer precedes him.

**Ch 2 (Underdark, Toril):** The first rod piece is in a Lolth worshiper base in the Underdark. For a dwarf king whose reclaimed hold sits above tunnels that connect to the Underdark, Lolth-aligned forces operating this close to home are a direct threat. If these cultists know about the tunnel networks near Hammersong Hall, Ollum's people are in danger.

**Ch 5 (Barovia):** Ollum encounters Strahd — a ruler who achieved immortality and absolute power over his domain, and is utterly, irredeemably miserable. Strahd is the dark mirror of everything Ollum fears becoming: a king so consumed by his kingdom that he lost everything that made him worth following. A bard who stopped singing.

**Ch 6 (Krynn):** Lord Soth — another cautionary tale of a ruler who fell. Soth was a Knight of Solamnia who betrayed his oath. His tragedy rhymes with Ollum's fear that he's not worthy of the crown. But where Soth fell because of pride and cowardice, Ollum's defining trait is stubborn, relentless heart. This chapter is where Ollum's arc turns — he stops asking whether he deserves to be king and starts acting like one.

**Ch 8 (Avernus):** The Red Belvedere casino. Ollum in a devil's gambling den is pure character gold. His charisma, his ability to work a room, his gift for reading people — these are the same skills that make him a good king, deployed in the most dangerous social environment imaginable. This isn't a dungeon crawl; it's a performance. And Ollum was born for it.

**Ch 11 (Cave of Shattered Reflection):** Vecna's unrealities include "Neverwinter's New King" — Vecna has turned Lord Neverember into a death knight tyrant, ruling through terror. For Ollum, who's spent years wrestling with what kingship means, this is the nightmare made manifest. A crown that corrupts. A kingdom built on fear instead of song. Dismantling this unreality isn't just a puzzle — it's Ollum declaring what kind of king he is.

## Hammer's Song: The Weapon That's Waking Up

Hammer's Song is developing sentience. Across the timeskip, it went from glowing during performances to freezing out anyone who isn't Ollum. This trajectory continues through the adventure.

### Progression

**Early chapters:** Hammer's Song resonates faintly with the Rod of Seven Parts. Both are artifacts carrying ancient purpose. When Ollum holds a rod piece, Hammer's Song hums — not in recognition, but in *kinship*. Two old things remembering what it means to be whole.

**Mid chapters:** As the party crosses planes, Hammer's Song reacts differently to each one. It sings louder in the Astral Sea (Ch 3), where thought shapes reality. It goes cold and silent in Barovia (Ch 5), as if refusing to acknowledge the Dread Domain. It burns hot in Avernus (Ch 8), straining toward something.

**Ch 10 (Pandemonium):** The howling winds of Pandemonium — a plane of maddening noise — should be unbearable. But Hammer's Song pushes back. It sings *against* the wind. For the first time, Ollum hears it clearly: not feelings, not warmth and cold, but a voice. Old. Dwarven. The voice of the forge that made it, centuries ago. It says: *Hold, son of the song.*

**Ch 11 (Endgame):** Hammer's Song is fully awakened. It can speak, though it's terse and ancient in its manner. It has opinions about Vecna's unrealities ("This is not real. Strike it down.") and about Ollum ("You are afraid. Good. Fear means you understand what you might lose.").

## Skitter: The Imperfect Companion

Thulduran's brass mechanical spider accompanies the party. He's flawed, endearing, and occasionally useful.

### Integration Points

**Ch 4 (Mournland/Eberron):** This is Skitter's chapter. The Mournland is full of constructs — Docents (sentient spheres that once powered colossi), warforged warriors, broken war machines. Thulduran has been struggling with Skitter's left foreleg for years. The problem isn't mechanical; it's enchantmental — the animation matrix doesn't distribute evenly.

In Eberron, construct technology is centuries ahead of anything on the Sword Coast. A Docent — or the remains of Landro's systems — could provide the missing insight. Thulduran finally fixes Skitter's leg. Or, more poignantly, he understands *why* it can't be fixed — and accepts the flaw as part of what makes Skitter *Skitter*.

**Scouting utility:** Skitter's small size and mechanical nature make him useful for scouting in several chapters — slipping through the webbed tunnels in Chapter 2, navigating Death House's narrow passages in Chapter 5, exploring the Tomb of Wayward Souls in Chapter 7 (where illusion magic affects living creatures but might not fool a construct).

**Ch 11:** Skitter's eye-lens — the one that fogs in humidity — could be immune to Vecna's unrealities. He's a construct. He doesn't have fears or secrets for Vecna to exploit. What Skitter sees is what's actually there. In the Cave of Shattered Reflection, the mechanical spider becomes the party's anchor to reality.

## Dagnabbet and Hammersong Hall: What's Waiting at Home

Ollum's letters with Princess Dagnabbet Waybeard and Steward Bronn Ironmantle don't stop during the adventure. These can be delivered as handouts between chapters — brief letters that arrive via magical courier, keeping the political subplot alive.

### Between-Chapter Letters

**After Ch 1:** Bronn reports increased orc activity. A trade caravan bound for Hammersong Hall was raided. The raiders took documents, not gold. Someone wants information.

**After Ch 3:** Dagnabbet writes that Mithral Hall's council has received "disturbing intelligence" about Vecna's cult operating in the North. The Battlehammer clan's dismissal of Hammersong Hall has softened — not out of respect, but out of need. They're looking for allies. For the first time, Ollum's reckless adventuring is an asset.

**After Ch 5:** Bronn reports that the orc scouts have retreated. Something scared them off. But miners in the lower tunnels have reported hearing chanting — in a language that isn't Orcish. The cult may have been using the orc incursions as cover for deeper activities.

**After Ch 7:** Dagnabbet's letter is shorter than usual. Her father is ill. The council is pressing harder on alliance proposals. She writes: "I find myself wishing you were here, which is inconvenient because the multiverse apparently needs you more. Come home when you can. Come home as the king I know you are."

**After Ch 9 (Kas's betrayal):** Bronn writes that Hammersong Hall has been attacked. Not by orcs — by undead. Cultists targeted the Great Forge, trying to corrupt it. Bronn and the guards held, barely. Forty-three souls, all safe. But Ollum now knows the stakes aren't abstract. Vecna's reach extends to his doorstep.

## Cross-Character Moments

The best integration isn't just character-to-adventure — it's character-to-character *within* the adventure.

**The Workshop Scene (between Ch 2 and Ch 3):** Thulduran needs to calibrate the telescope for astral observation. He needs silverwork. Again. Ollum is right there. They recreate the Kythorn workshop scene from Year Three — Ollum working the forge while Thulduran inscribes enchantments, arguing about nothing important while doing something critical. The other party members see, for the first time, how these two work. It's not friendship in the conventional sense. It's something older and more stubborn.

**Ollum Sings to the Telescope (Ch 6 or 7):** The telescope isn't responding. The planar interference is too strong. Thulduran is frustrated, running calculations, checking alignments. Ollum, who understands nothing about planar physics, picks up Hammer's Song and starts playing — a dwarven forge ballad, something old. The telescope resonates. The frequency of the song cuts through the interference. Thulduran stares. "That shouldn't have worked," he says. "And yet," says Ollum.

**Thulduran Sees What Ollum Can't (Ch 11):** In the Cave of Shattered Reflection, Ollum faces the "Neverwinter's New King" unreality — a vision of corrupted kingship. He's shaken. It hits too close. Thulduran, who has never once told Ollum he believes in him — who has never said anything warmer than "your metalwork is adequate" — quietly says: "That is not you. I have observed you for years. The data does not support that outcome." It is the most emotionally vulnerable thing Thulduran has ever said. He will deny it later.

## Bringing In New Players

The adventure expects 2 more PCs. Their characters should:

- Have their own reasons for being in Neverwinter (the backstory tables on page 14 offer good hooks)
- Connect to either Thulduran or Ollum's network naturally (e.g., a craftsperson who worked at Hammersong Hall, a scholar who studied under Selenar, someone from Dagnabbet's circle)
- Have personal stakes that interweave with the existing threads rather than running parallel

Once player concepts are in, we can build similar integration docs for their arcs.

---

## Implementation Notes

- All of the above is additive — nothing contradicts or replaces the published adventure
- The telescope mechanic can be as simple or as crunchy as desired (narrative flavor vs. actual skill checks)
- Between-chapter letters are easy handouts to prepare in Foundry as journal entries
- Hammer's Song's evolution can be tracked with a simple progression table tied to chapter milestones
- Selenar breadcrumbs should be subtle — one per arc, not every chapter
