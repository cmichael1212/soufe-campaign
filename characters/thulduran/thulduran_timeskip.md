## 7th of Uktar, Year One

I have returned to Silverymoon.

The journey from the Sword Coast was uneventful, which suited me fine. After the business with the orcs and the citadel and all those *people* requiring explanations for things they ought to have understood themselves, I welcomed the silence. Ollum offered to accompany me as far as Everlund, singing the entire way, naturally. I declined, though not unkindly. The dwarf means well. He simply hasn't yet grasped that not every moment requires a soundtrack.

Selenar's estate is as I left it. Dust on the reading tables. Her half-finished cup of blackmoss tea still sits on the windowsill in the study — I cannot bring myself to move it. The university's Bursar, a tedious man named Aldenmere, met me at the gate with documents. After three years missing, the Convocation has agreed to grant me stewardship of the property and its contents "in trust, pending resolution of Professor Selenar's status." A deliberately temporary phrase. They want me to know this is borrowed.

I signed the papers without argument. I am not here for the house. I am here for her library.

## 22nd of Hammer, Year One

I have begun cross-referencing the star charts I acquired during our travels with the observatory logs kept by the university's Department of Celestial Studies. The department head, a sun elf named Vaelithra, was courteous enough when granting me access, though she made a point of noting that "guest privileges are reviewed annually." I thanked her and refrained from mentioning that her department's cataloguing system contains no fewer than fourteen redundancies. Restraint is a virtue I am cultivating.

The charts are promising. Several notations in *Meridian's Treatise on Astral Currents* align with observations I made through the telescope during our time in the field. But the alignments are imprecise — close enough to suggest a pattern, too loose to confirm one. I need better data. I need to observe more consistently, from a fixed position, over months.

Fortunately, I appear to have nowhere else to be.

## 3rd of Mirtul, Year One

Selenar's personal library is extraordinary. Three hundred and twelve volumes I have catalogued so far, and I suspect another hundred remain in the storage cases she kept in the cellar. Her collection on illusory theory alone surpasses anything the university holds publicly — which I suspect they know, and which I suspect is the actual reason they granted me stewardship rather than seizing the estate outright.

I found a pressed flower between the pages of her copy of *Mordenkainen's Luminous Geometries*. Silverbell. She always kept them on her desk.

I have not opened that book again.

## 14th of Eleint, Year Two

A frustrating realization: the work I need to do next cannot be done here. Silverymoon excels at theory, contemplation, the gentle art of reading about things other people have built. What I require is a *forge*. Tools. Materials. Space to fail loudly and at scale.

After some inquiry, I have secured a lease on a modest workshop in Waterdeep's Trades Ward. The rent is offensive — one could fund a small expedition for what they charge per tenday — but the space is adequate. High ceilings, a reinforced workbench, and neighbors who are apparently accustomed to occasional explosions. The landlord, a dragonborn woman named Krath, asked only that I "keep the fires inside the building." I assured her I would endeavor to do so.

I will split my time between cities. Research in Silverymoon. Construction in Waterdeep. It is inefficient, but necessity makes architects of us all.

## 1st of Nightal, Year Two

A breakthrough, or the ghost of one.

For months I have been conducting parallel observations: tracking the lit points on my stone against known stellar positions using the university's ephemeris tables. The correlation should be straightforward — if the points represent stars, they should match. They do not. Not a single point on the stone corresponds to a catalogued star, planet, or satellite.

At first I assumed error. I recalibrated. I checked my arithmetic — twice, then a third time out of spite toward the numbers themselves. No error.

The points on the stone are not tracking celestial bodies. They are tracking something *else*. Something that moves in relation to the stars but is not of them. The rotation I observed years ago is not stellar drift. It is... I do not yet know what it is. But it is *real*, it is *measurable*, and it is the most exciting data I have encountered since I first looked through the telescope.

I may have shouted. The librarian gave me a look. I gave her one back.

## 19th of Ches, Year Three

I have named him Skitter.

He is, objectively, not a success. His left foreleg seizes every forty seconds with metronomic reliability. He cannot climb surfaces steeper than thirty degrees without tumbling backward in a manner that would be comedic if it were not so costly to repair. His visual lens fogs in humidity, which in Waterdeep means it fogs *constantly*. And he has developed an inexplicable fixation on copper coins — I found seven of them stuffed into his thorax cavity last tenday, which I did not program and cannot explain.

And yet. He moves. He responds to basic commands. He navigates a room, avoids obstacles — most obstacles — and returns to me when called. He is a mechanical spider approximately the size of a housecat, built from brass and iron and a dozen enchantments I had to invent because the existing literature on construct animation is, frankly, embarrassing.

He is my first. He is deeply flawed. I am unreasonably proud of him.

Krath saw him skittering across the workshop floor and did not even flinch. "Seen worse," she said. I believe her.

## 18th of Mirtul, Year Three

I have swallowed my pride and written to Ollum.

The cradle design exists in my head — I can *see* it, a lattice of silver wire woven into a concave frame to seat the stone at the telescope's focal point. The geometry is sound. The enchantment schema is elegant, if I say so myself, which I do. The problem is that my hands are those of a scholar, not a smith. Six attempts at working the silver wire have produced six misshapen disasters that would not hold a grape, let alone channel planar energy. The wire must be drawn to a precise and uniform gauge thinner than spider silk, and the weave tolerances are measured in fractions of a hair's width. This is not a task for enthusiasm and good intentions. This is master-level metalwork.

Ollum Hammersong — King of a reclaimed dwarven hall, dual-wielder of legendary weapons, and the only person I know who can forge metal with the precision this requires — also happens to be a friend. So I wrote to him. I described the technical requirements in detail, included diagrams, and asked if he might spare a tenday to visit Waterdeep and assist.

His reply arrived in four days. It read, in its entirety: "On my way. Don't touch the silver until I get there. — O."

Efficient. Surprisingly so, for a man who once took forty-five minutes to tell a barmaid about his great-great-great-grandfather.

## 2nd of Kythorn, Year Three

Ollum has been in Waterdeep for six days now and I must confess two things.

First: the dwarf's skill at the forge is *extraordinary*. I do not say this lightly. I have studied artificer techniques across eleven reference texts and observed the work of three so-called master craftsmen in the Trades Ward. None of them — not one — could do what Ollum did on his second day here. He examined my diagrams for perhaps ten minutes, asked two questions (both insightful, annoyingly so), heated a crucible, and drew silver wire so fine and uniform that I had to use a magnification cantrip to confirm it was real. "It's just metal, Thully," he said, as though he had not just accomplished in an afternoon what I had failed to do in three tendays. He calls me "Thully." I have asked him to stop. He has not stopped.

The lattice frame is taking shape under his hands. He works the wire with a delicacy that seems impossible for fingers that thick, humming some dwarven forge-song the entire time. Always humming. Always singing. The man cannot exist in silence for more than thirty seconds — I have timed it. When he is not singing, he is telling stories to Krath, my landlord, who appears genuinely entertained. When he is not telling stories to Krath, he is telling stories to the barmaid at the tavern across the street. When he is not telling stories to the barmaid, he is *leaving with* the barmaid, returning the next morning smelling of ale and perfume and looking enormously pleased with himself.

"You should get out more, Thully," he told me this morning, still wearing yesterday's shirt. "There's a whole city out there."

"I am aware of the city, Ollum. I rent a workshop in it."

"That's not what I mean and you know it."

I do know what he means. I simply have no interest in spending my evenings the way he spends his. Some of us have *research*.

Second confession: I am genuinely glad he is here. The workshop feels less like a workspace and more like — I don't know. Something warmer. He brought a cask of ale from Hammersong Hall and insists we drink a cup each evening while he subjects me to the day's new ballad or saga or comedic limerick. They are, occasionally, not terrible.

I will not tell him that.

## 6th of Kythorn, Year Three

The cradle is finished.

Ollum left yesterday morning, after a final inspection of the frame that involved him holding it up to the light, squinting, tapping it once with a fingernail, and declaring "Aye, she'll hold." As farewells go, he also subjected me to a rib-crushing embrace and made me promise to visit Hammersong Hall before the year was out. I promised. I may even keep it.

The design is a lattice of silver wire — Ollum's wire, drawn finer than I could have managed in a lifetime — woven into a concave frame that seats the stone at the precise focal point of the telescope's primary lens. The metalwork is his. The enchantment is mine. I spent two days inscribing each strand individually, channeling the stone's emanations into the optical path without diffusing them. My hands still ache.

Tonight, for the first time, I observed through the telescope with the stone seated in its cradle.

The sky was *different*.

At four points along the northern horizon, where my naked eye and the unaugmented telescope show nothing but darkness between stars, I saw — shimmers. Faint, iridescent distortions, like heat rising from summer stone but *vertical*, hanging in the sky. They pulsed slowly, not in unison but in a rhythm I could almost feel in my teeth.

I do not know what they are. I believe — I *suspect* — they are points where the boundary between our plane and another grows thin. Gateways, perhaps. Or the scars where gateways once opened. Or the places where they might yet form.

I observed for four hours. I filled eleven pages with sketches and measurements. My hands were shaking by the end, and not from the cold.

I am close to something. I can feel it.

## 28th of Marpenoth, Year Four

Damn this city and its politics.

A Professor Thandril — whom I have never met and who has published precisely *nothing* of note in the last decade, I checked — has filed a petition with the Convocation to "reassess the stewardship arrangement" regarding Selenar's estate. His argument, such as it is, amounts to the claim that the university's property interests are "inadequately served by a non-affiliated resident of uncertain academic standing."

*Uncertain academic standing.* I have forgotten more about illusory theory than this man has read. I have built a functional automaton. I have made observational breakthroughs that his department could not achieve in fifty years of staring at the same stars through the same instruments while writing the same papers citing each other's identical conclusions.

But I am not *faculty*. I am not even a formal guest researcher. I am the deep gnome who lives in a missing professor's house, and that is all they see.

I will deal with Thandril. But not today. Today I have more important work.

## 9th of Uktar, Year Four

I found Selenar's notebooks.

Not her academic publications — those I have read many times. These are personal research journals, hidden in a false panel behind the cellar wine rack. Seven leather-bound volumes in her precise, elegant script. She was methodical, as always. She dated every entry.

She was studying planar convergences.

The same phenomena. The same shimmers I can barely resolve through my telescope — she was theorizing about them *years* before I ever looked through a lens. Her mathematics are elegant, her observations meticulous. She had mapped provisional locations for what she called "thinning points" along the Sword Coast, and she was developing a theoretical framework for predicting when they might open.

Her final volume ends mid-sentence. The last dated entry is three days before she disappeared.

I sat in the cellar for a very long time after reading that.

She was ahead of me. She was *always* ahead of me. And whatever she found — whatever she saw or calculated or understood that I have not yet reached — it took her somewhere. Or something took her because of it.

I will not stop. If this path leads to where she went, then it leads to her.

## 15th of Tarsakh, Year Five

Skitter lost a leg again. The left foreleg — always the left foreleg. I have rebuilt that joint nine times now. I am beginning to suspect the problem is not mechanical but enchantmental; the animation matrix does not distribute evenly across asymmetric limb structures. I need better reference material on force distribution in constructed entities, and nothing in Silverymoon or Waterdeep has what I need. I have read everything. *Everything.*

The telescope is the same. I can see the shimmers. I can measure their positions. I can correlate them, roughly, with the stone's point-map. But I cannot *resolve* them. I cannot tell what lies beyond. I cannot differentiate one planar signature from another. It is as though I am standing before a row of locked doors and I can see the doors but cannot see the rooms behind them, cannot read the signs above them, cannot even determine if they are doors at all or merely painted on the wall.

I need a lens. A filter. Something that can separate planar light into its constituent frequencies the way a prism separates white light into color. Such a thing must exist — the theory demands it. But if anyone on the Sword Coast has built one, they have not written about it, and if they have written about it, they have not written about it in any language I can read, and I can read eleven.

Selenar's notebooks end where my understanding ends. She knew what came next but did not write it down, or wrote it down and took it with her.

---

## 2nd of Kythorn, Year Five

Thandril's petition advances. The Convocation has scheduled a "review hearing" for the autumn. Aldenmere delivered the notice personally, with what I can only describe as performative sympathy. "I'm sure it will all work out," he said, in the tone of a man who is sure of nothing and cares about less.

Let them have their hearing. If they take the estate, they take it. The wine rack is empty anyway — I removed the notebooks months ago. And Selenar's books are already catalogued in my memory, every one. They can have the shelves.

I am growing tired of Silverymoon. I am growing tired of Waterdeep. I am growing tired of libraries that have shown me everything they have to show, and markets that sell variations of things I have already bought, and scholars who study the edges of the map but never venture past them.

The answers are not here. I have known this for some time, if I am honest. The telescope shows me doors I cannot open. The stone shows me a map I cannot fully read. Selenar followed this same path and it led her beyond the reach of anyone who stayed behind.

I do not know where to go. But I know I cannot stay.

Skitter sits on the corner of my desk, his one working eye-lens tracking my quill as I write. His left foreleg twitches. I should fix it.

Tomorrow, perhaps. Tonight I will look through the telescope one more time, at shimmers I cannot name, and hope that something changes.
