## A Letter Between Innkeepers

*From Marta Copperkettle, proprietor of the Bright Hearth Inn, Triboar, to her cousin Demetria of the Slug & Lettuce, Turgus. Year One.*

---

Demetria,

You will not believe what walked into my tavern last Greengrass.

A hill dwarf. Young — couldn't have been more than eighty, maybe ninety. Broad as a barrel, red in the face before he'd had a single drink, and LOUD. I could hear him from the kitchen before he'd cleared the front door. He comes stomping in like he owns the place, slams both palms on the bar, and hollers — and I mean HOLLERS — "INNKEEP! Your finest ale, your warmest hearth, and your biggest audience! King Ollum Hammersong has arrived and he's got a tale that'll curl yer beard!"

Now, we get all sorts through Triboar. Adventurers, merchants, the odd noble who took a wrong turn at Longsaddle. But I have never in my thirty years behind a bar had a dwarf announce himself as a king and demand an audience in the same breath.

Half the room laughed. He didn't care. Not one bit.

He ordered three ales (drank them all), tipped generously, and then — without anyone actually agreeing to a performance — climbed onto a table, pulled out the most beautiful warhammer I have ever seen, and started singing.

Demetria, I cannot explain what happened next except to say that for twenty minutes, nobody in that room breathed. The dwarf can SING. I don't mean he carries a tune — I mean the air itself changed. One moment he's belting out a war ballad about his ancestors and half the room is stomping their feet, and the next he's singing something soft about a kingdom lost and found and old Marget the fishwife is openly weeping into her stew.

He performed for two hours. TWO HOURS. He did songs, he did stories, he did jokes that would make a sailor blush. At one point he challenged the biggest man in the room to an arm wrestling contest and LOST, spectacularly, then bought the man a drink and sang a song about the defeat before the man had finished laughing.

The strangest part? That hammer. Midway through a particularly rousing war song, the thing started GLOWING. Faint, warm light, like a coal in the dark. And I swear on mother's grave, I heard a second voice — deep, old, rumbling — joining in on the chorus. In Dwarvish. The dwarf didn't seem surprised. Just grinned wider and sang louder.

He stayed two nights. Didn't pay for the second — the other guests covered it. When he left, he kissed my hand, called me "the finest innkeep north of Waterdeep," and marched out the door singing at the top of his lungs.

King or not, he's welcome back anytime.

— Marta

P.S. — He left with Syla. You know, the red-haired merchant's daughter who comes through every tenday? She didn't seem to mind one bit.

## Report to His Majesty King Ollum Hammersong

*From Bronn Ironmantle, Steward of Hammersong Hall. Year Three, month of Eleasis.*

---

Your Majesty,

Monthly report as requested. I'll keep it plain since I know you skip the long ones.

**Progress:**
The Great Forge is fully operational. Took us the better part of six months to clear the debris and replace the bellows mechanism, but Smithmaster Hild has it running hot and true. She says the original ventilation channels built into the mountain are "the finest dwarven engineering she's seen outside Citadel Adbar." Her words. First proper weapons and tools came out of the forge last tenday. Morale improved considerably — nothing puts heart in a dwarf like the sound of a working hammer.

Main Hall restoration is complete. The throne — your throne — is cleaned, repaired, and set. The Hammersong banner hangs above it. I won't lie, Your Majesty. The day we unfurled that banner, a few of us got something in our eyes. Dust, probably. Old hall. Lots of dust.

Current population: forty-three souls. Thirty-one dwarves, eight humans, four halflings. The humans are mostly laborers and a stonemason from Mirabar who's worth every copper we pay her. The halflings run the kitchens and I will fight anyone who suggests replacing them.

**Setbacks:**
East residential wing suffered a partial collapse in Flamerule. Nobody killed, thank Moradin, but Kettrin broke his arm and we lost two months of restoration work. The stone there is old and the supports were compromised — probably orc damage from when they held the place. Stonemason says it can be shored up but it'll take time and timber we don't have in surplus.

Orc scouts spotted twice along the northern ridge in the last two months. Small groups — three to five. Watching, not attacking. I doubled the watch and sent a patrol but they'd melted into the hills. I don't think they're the same clan you cleared out years ago, but they know we're here. If their numbers grow, we'll need to address it.

**Recruitment:**
This is where I must be honest with you, Your Majesty, because you asked me to be and because I'd rather you hear it from me than from some sneering emissary.

I sent word to Clan Battlehammer in Mithral Hall and Clan Stoneshaft in Citadel Adbar, inviting settlers and craftsdwarves to Hammersong Hall. Clan Stoneshaft declined politely. Clan Battlehammer's response was... less polite. The phrase "a bard cannot hold stone" was used. I believe the full sentiment was that Hammersong Hall's claim is "historically interesting but practically unproven" and that they would "watch with interest" before committing resources.

It stings. I know it stings you worse. But we have forty-three people who DID come, who believe in this place and in you. That counts for more than any clan's letter.

**The Weapons:**
I must also report something I do not fully understand.

During the orc scout incursion last month — the second one, when three of them got bold enough to approach the lower gate — you were away in Waterdeep helping Master Gleamshadow with his contraption. I took four of our guard to drive them off. Standard engagement, nothing we couldn't handle.

But I was carrying Hammer's Song. You'd left it mounted in the Great Hall, as you do, and when the alarm sounded I grabbed the nearest weapon. The moment I touched it, it went cold. Ice cold. My fingers seized and I nearly dropped it. Kettrin handed me a proper axe instead and I went out with that.

Here's the thing, Your Majesty. When I set Hammer's Song back on its mount after the skirmish, it was warm again. And I heard — or felt, I can't rightly say which — something like displeasure. Like a low growl you feel in your chest rather than hear with your ears.

That weapon knows who you are. And it did not appreciate being picked up by someone else.

You might want to have a conversation with it. I realize how that sounds.

Your servant,
Bronn Ironmantle

## Letter from Princess Dagnabbet Waybeard to King Ollum Hammersong

*Year Two, month of Marpenoth. Sealed with the Waybeard crest.*

---

Ollum,

Your gift arrived. A cask of Hammersong ale and a ballad written in my honor. The ale was excellent. The ballad was... Ollum, you rhymed "Dagnabbet" with "dagger habit." I do not have a dagger habit. I have *one* dagger. It is ceremonial.

Father found the ballad amusing, which is either a good sign or a terrible one. With him, I can never tell. He asked when "the Hammersong boy" would visit Mithral Hall properly, "not just to drink our reserves dry." I believe that constitutes an invitation, though knowing Father, it may also constitute a warning.

I have been thinking about your Hall. You described the Great Forge relit, the banner hung, the sound of hammers ringing through the mountain for the first time in centuries. I could hear the pride in your words even through the page, and I want you to know — it is deserved. What you have done is remarkable. A lost kingdom reclaimed by the last of its line, through stubbornness and song and sheer dwarven will. There are lords in Mithral Hall who have inherited more and accomplished less.

But I must say something you will not like, because I would be a poor friend — and a poorer princess — if I did not.

Forty-three people is not a kingdom, Ollum. It is a village. A brave, loyal village with a magnificent forge and a king who can outsing any bard on the Sword Coast, but a village nonetheless. Mithral Hall's council has taken notice of Hammersong Hall's claim, and their assessment is... cautious. There are those who see an opportunity for alliance. There are others who see a ruin with a charming occupant.

I tell you this not to wound you but to arm you. You have never been one to shy from a fight, and this is one worth winning — but it is won with patience and stone, not steel and song.

Come to Mithral Hall for Midwinter. Bring your best ale and leave the ballads about my "dagger habit" at home.

Yours,
Dagnabbet

## Letter from King Ollum Hammersong to Thulduran Gleamshadow

*Year Three, month of Mirtul. Delivered by courier to Silverymoon, forwarded to Waterdeep.*

---

THULLY!

Got your letter. Had to read it three times on account of all the fancy words — you know I skipped that part of my education on account of ACTUALLY DOING THINGS instead of reading about them — but I believe the gist is: you need a dwarf who can work silver wire thinner than an elf's patience, and you need him yesterday.

Well you're in LUCK, my diminutive friend, because I have been going absolutely BARKING MAD in this mountain. Don't get me wrong — I love the Hall. I love my people. I love the forge and the banner and the sound of hammers. But Thully, if I have to sit through one more meeting about TIMBER ALLOCATION I am going to throw myself down the ventilation shaft.

Bronn — my steward, you'd like him, he's sensible and grim, two things you respect in a person — Bronn has things well in hand. He doesn't need me hovering. What he needs is for me to stop rearranging the stockroom and go be useful somewhere else for a tenday.

So YES. I am coming to Waterdeep. I am coming IMMEDIATELY. I will work your silver wire and I will fix whatever other ridiculous thing you've broken in that workshop of yours and in exchange you will BUY ME ALE and LISTEN TO MY NEW BALLAD. It's about a gnome who builds a metal spider. You'll hate it. It's my best work.

Also, I have something to tell you about the hammer. Hammer's Song. It's... talking to me, Thully. Not in words, not yet, more like feelings. Warmth when I'm doing right by the clan. Cold when I'm not. And during a skirmish last month — I wasn't even there, Bronn had it — the thing FROZE him out. Wouldn't let anyone else wield it. I don't know what that means but you're the smartest person I know, even if you're insufferable about it, so maybe you can help me figure it out.

Don't touch the silver until I get there.

— O.

P.S. The ale I'm bringing is from our first proper batch out of the restored forge-casks. It is MAGNIFICENT. You will drink it and you will LIKE IT.

## Letter from King Ollum Hammersong to Princess Dagnabbet Waybeard

*Year Four, month of Uktar. Uncharacteristically neat handwriting. No ale stains.*

---

Dagnabbet,

I've started this letter four times now and each time I end up throwing it in the fire, which is not like me because I usually say whatever fool thing comes into my head and deal with the consequences after. But this one matters, so I'm trying to get it right.

You asked me, last time we spoke, whether I'd thought about what kind of king I want to be. I said something loud and probably stupid and you gave me that look — the one where your left eyebrow goes up about half an inch and I know I've stepped in it.

I've been thinking about it since. Honestly thinking, not just making noise.

Here's the truth, Dag. Some days I wake up in that Hall, in that throne room with the Hammersong banner above me, and I feel like the luckiest dwarf who ever drew breath. My ancestors built this place. They carved it out of living rock with their bare hands and the strength of their will, and I — Ollum, the bard who couldn't get steady work in Neverwinter — I brought it back. That's real. That means something.

But other days I wake up and I feel like I'm wearing someone else's armor. Too big. Too heavy. Forty-three people look to me to keep them safe and fed and I think — what do I know about that? I know songs. I know stories. I can swing a hammer and charm a crowd and drink any dwarf in the North under the table, but a king? A real king?

My great-great-great-grandfather Hamish was a real king. He built something that lasted centuries. I've been at this five years and I've got a crumbling east wing, orc scouts on the ridge, and a letter from Clan Battlehammer telling me a bard can't hold stone.

Maybe they're right. Maybe a bard can't.

But a Hammersong can. And that's what I am, even when I don't feel like it. Even when I'd rather be on the road with a song and a crowd and nobody depending on me for anything more than the next verse.

I know things between us have been... complicated. I know I'm not what your father had in mind for you and I know Mithral Hall's council sees Hammersong Hall as a gamble at best. I won't pretend that doesn't sting, because it does, and I won't pretend I'm something I'm not just to impress people who've already made up their minds about me.

But I'm not giving up. Not on the Hall. Not on us. Not on any of it.

I just needed you to know that sometimes the loud dwarf is also the scared one. Don't tell anyone I said that. I have a reputation.

Yours, even when I'm an idiot,
Ollum

## Letter from Princess Dagnabbet Waybeard to King Ollum Hammersong

*Year Four, month of Nightal. Sealed with the Waybeard crest. The seal was pressed harder than usual.*

---

Ollum,

I will not tell anyone you said that. Not because you asked, but because the dwarf who wrote that letter deserves better than to have his honesty turned into gossip.

You asked me once — loudly, in front of my father's entire dining hall — whether I'd ever met a dwarf as handsome as you. I said no, because I hadn't, and because your face when I said it was worth every disapproving look from every advisor in the room.

But handsomeness is not what keeps me writing to you. It is this. What you just did. The willingness to say a true thing even when it costs you.

I must be honest with you in return.

Father's council has been... persistent regarding my future. There are proposals. Alliances that would benefit Mithral Hall strategically. Names of dwarven lords from established holds with proven bloodlines and stable economies. I have declined them all, but declining is becoming more difficult, and I am running out of polite ways to do it.

I am not telling you this to pressure you or to issue an ultimatum. I am telling you because you were brave enough to be honest and you deserve the same.

I do not know where this goes, Ollum. I know that I think about you more than is politically convenient. I know that your ballads are terrible and I keep every one of them. I know that Hammersong Hall is not yet what it needs to be, and neither are we.

But "not yet" is not "never." And I have learned, watching you, that stubbornness and song can accomplish more than anyone expects.

Do not give up. On any of it.

— Dag

P.S. — I do NOT have a dagger habit. But I have added a second dagger. It seemed prudent.

## Report to His Majesty King Ollum Hammersong

*From Bronn Ironmantle, Steward of Hammersong Hall. Year Five, month of Tarsakh. Marked URGENT in red ink — the first time Bronn has ever used the designation.*

---

Your Majesty,

I'll skip the pleasantries. You need to read this.

**The River.**
Three tendays ago, Smithmaster Hild sent a crew to inspect the lower waterways — the underground river system that feeds our cisterns and runs south through the deep channels toward Stone Tooth. Routine work. Checking for blockages, erosion, the usual.

They came back inside an hour. The water is wrong.

I went down myself to be sure. The river, from the third junction southward, has turned acidic. Not strongly — you can still touch it without burning, though Kettrin said it stung his hands after a few minutes. But the stone along the banks is corroded. Pitted and soft, like chalk where it should be granite. And the fish are dead. Every one of them, belly-up, pale, floating in a line along the current. The smell is foul — sharp, chemical, not like rot. Like something *caustic* has been seeping into the water upstream.

Hild sealed the lower cistern intake as a precaution. We're drawing from the upper springs only now, which is adequate but not ideal long-term.

Your Majesty, I know what lives downstream. I know what escaped from Stone Tooth before you reclaimed the Hall. I hoped it had crawled off to some distant swamp to lick its wounds and trouble us no more. I am no longer confident in that hope.

**The Road.**
A Mirabar trade caravan — the Thornhelm company, twelve wagons, twenty-odd guards — was destroyed on the road through the eastern High Forest six tendays ago. We only learned of it last month when a survivor stumbled into a logging camp near the Lost Peaks. He was burned. Not by fire. The wounds were chemical — flesh eaten through in streaks, the way acid runs downhill. He said the attack came from above. At night. He said the trees dissolved where the creature spat. He said it was black, and enormous, and that it *laughed*.

He died two days later. The loggers buried him and sent word south. The news reached us through a Citadel Adbar courier.

Twelve wagons, Your Majesty. Twenty guards. That is not the work of the half-starved wyrm you drove from the lake beneath Stone Tooth. Whatever that creature was five years ago, it has grown.

**The Hunters.**
I sent a quiet inquiry to our contacts in Triboar and Longsaddle — traders, hunters, folk who travel the roads and know what moves in the wild. What came back was... more than I expected.

A woodcutter near the Dessarin Hills found a stretch of forest — two hundred yards of ancient oak — melted. Bark stripped, wood softened to pulp, the ground beneath black and barren. No fire. No char. Just dissolution.

A shepherd on the northern edge of the High Forest lost his entire flock in a single night. Found them in the morning with their wool fused to their skin. Acid. He didn't see what did it, but he found a track in the mud. A single print, deep and clawed. He said it was the size of a wagon wheel.

And a ranger — a woman named Earsa who runs traplines between the Star Mountains and the Lost Peaks — claims she's seen a black shape in the sky three times this past winter. Always at night. Always heading south, toward the Mere of Dead Men or the marshes beyond. She says it's bigger each time she sees it. She says the last time, the moonlight caught its hide and it looked like "wet iron."

I don't know if all of these are the same creature, Your Majesty. But I know what black dragons do when they grow. They find territory. They poison it. They make it theirs. And the territory this one seems to be claiming runs right through the High Forest — right past our doorstep.

**My Recommendation.**
I am not an alarmist. You know that about me. I have served you plainly and I have never raised an alarm I didn't believe was warranted.

This one is warranted.

The dragon you fought beneath Stone Tooth has not forgotten where it was humiliated. It has spent five years growing stronger, and its hunting ground now encircles Hammersong Hall. The acidic river is not an accident. It is a message, or a test, or the first move in something longer.

We are forty-three people with a working forge and strong walls, but we are not equipped to fight a dragon. Not one that has grown this much. We need allies, or we need a plan, or we need both.

Come home when you can, Your Majesty. And if you happen to know a wizard with a clever telescope and a talent for seeing things others can't, this might be worth mentioning to him as well.

Your servant,
Bronn Ironmantle

P.S. — I had the lower river passage sealed with a rockfall. If that thing tries to swim upstream to our doorstep, it will find the door shut. For now.

## Reply from King Ollum Hammersong to Steward Bronn Ironmantle

*Year Five, month of Tarsakh. Written in haste from a tavern in Waterdeep. The parchment smells of ale and fury. Several words are underlined so hard the quill tore through.*

---

BRONN!

By Hamish's BEARD, I read your letter three times and each time my blood ran hotter than the Great Forge at full bellows!

That slitherin' winged serpent! I KNEW that overgrown acid-spittin' lizard was too ornery to crawl off and die proper! Five years — FIVE YEARS — that foul, festerin' worm has been skulkin' around OUR mountains, poisonin' OUR river, terrorizin' OUR roads, and growin' fat on stolen cattle and Mirabar caravans while I've been sittin' in council meetings arguin' about TIMBER QUOTAS! There's always a flaw in the ore, Bronn, and that scaly black-hearted varmint is the biggest flaw we got!

Twelve wagons! Twenty guards! And the cursed thing LAUGHED?! I'll give it somethin' to laugh about — the flat side of Hammer's Song right between its beady yellow eyes! And I'll tell you somethin' else — Hammer's Song has been rumblin' in my grip ever since your letter arrived. That weapon KNOWS. It can smell a fight comin' the way I can smell bad ale, and brother, this ale STINKS.

You did RIGHT sealin' the lower passage. Good, solid, sensible Bronn — that's why I made you steward and not that gabbin' halfsie merchant who wanted the job. A rockfall won't stop a grown dragon forever and we both know it, but it buys us time, and time is what we need.

Now LISTEN. Here's what I need you to do and I need you to do it FAST:

FIRST — double the watch on the lower tunnels. Not just the sealed passage, ALL of them. That slitherin' serpent knows those tunnels better than we do — she LIVED down there. If there's another way in, she'll find it, and I won't have her creepin' up through some forgotten crack while our people sleep.

SECOND — send word to that ranger woman, Earsa. Hire her if you have to. I want to know where that dragon LAIRS. The Mere of Dead Men, the marshes, wherever she's denned up — I want to know. You can't hammer out the details of a fight if you don't know where the anvil sits.

THIRD — write to Citadel Adbar and Mithral Hall. Yes, I KNOW what Clan Battlehammer said about us. I don't care. A dragon claimin' territory in the High Forest ain't just our problem — it's EVERYONE'S problem. If those long-eared galoots in Silverymoon haven't noticed a full-grown black dragon flyin' over their precious forests, they're even more useless than Thully says they are, and Thully says they're PLENTY useless.

I'm headed to Neverwinter on Hall business — trade routes, Neverember, the whole kettle — and I CAN'T put it off. The Hall needs those trade agreements or we'll be eatin' mushrooms and good intentions through another winter. But I'll be back soon as the ink is dry, and when I get back, by Hamish's beard, we are gonna have a CONVERSATION about that dragon.

Not a polite conversation. Not a diplomatic conversation. The kind of conversation that ends with a dragon's head mounted above the Great Forge and a NEW ballad for the ages.

Tell Hild to keep the forge hot. Tell Kettrin to mind his arm. Tell Pimble her mushroom stew had better be ready when I get home because I'm gonna need the fortification.

And Bronn — keep our people safe. All forty-three of 'em. That's not a request from your king. That's a promise from your friend. Nobody touches what's mine.

NOBODY.

— King Ollum Hammersong, Lord of the Lost Peaks, Reclaimer of the Hall, and Soon-To-Be Dragon Slayer

P.S. — I AM mentionin' it to Thully. That gnome's got a telescope that can see across dimensions but can't find his own cold box. If anyone can figure out what that varmint's been up to, it's him. Don't tell him I said that. His head's big enough.

## A Song, Unfinished

*Found among King Ollum's personal effects at Hammersong Hall. Year Five. Written in his hand, with several crossed-out lines and ale rings on the margins.*

---

*There's a throne in the mountain, carved deep in the stone,*
*Where a Hammersong sits, but he sits there alone.*
*The forge fires are burning, the banner flies true,*
*But the road's always calling — what's a king supposed to do?*

*He swore to his people, he swore to the Hall,*
*He'd hold back the darkness and never let fall*
*The name of his fathers, the weight of the crown —*
*But sometimes the crown is what's dragging him down.*

*So he sings to the mountain and the mountain sings back,*
*A voice old as iron from deep in the black.*
*It says: "Hold, little king. Hold, son of the song.*
*The road will be waiting. It won't wait for long."*

*(bridge — something about Dag here? or the lads? or both? come back to this)*

*(needs a bloody ending, can't figure it out, maybe that's the point)*

---

*[No further personal correspondence was found beyond routine administrative matters and supply orders. The final official document on file is a leave-of-absence notice filed with Steward Ironmantle, dated early in Year Six, citing "urgent business of a nature I'll explain when I understand it myself."]*
